# Playwright MCP Reliability Improvements Summary

## Problem Identified
Your Playwright MCP container was experiencing intermittent availability issues in Cursor, causing the MCP status to turn red and tools to become unavailable.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Insufficient health monitoring** - Container health checks were only checking process existence, not actual MCP endpoint availability
2. **Resource constraints** - No memory limits or resource management
3. **Browser cache issues** - Browser installations were not persisted between restarts
4. **Startup reliability** - No proper error handling or startup verification
5. **Connection stability** - No automatic recovery mechanisms

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Docker Configuration (`docker-compose.yml`)
- **Better health checks**: Now tests actual MCP endpoint response instead of just process existence
- **Resource management**: Added memory limits (4GB max, 2GB reserved) to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Persistent browser cache**: Added `browser_cache` volume to persist browser installations
- **Improved logging**: Added log rotation and size limits
- **Environment variables**: Added all necessary Playwright and Chrome environment variables

### 2. Improved Dockerfile
- **Simplified startup**: Removed problematic startup script, using direct MCP server command
- **Better health checks**: HTTP-based health checks that verify actual MCP endpoint availability
- **Proper permissions**: Fixed browser cache permissions and sandbox settings

### 3. Monitoring Script (`monitor-playwright.sh`)
- **Comprehensive monitoring**: Checks container status, health, MCP endpoint, and process
- **Automatic recovery**: Automatically restarts container when issues are detected
- **Logging**: Detailed logging of all operations and issues
- **Multiple modes**: Status check, continuous monitoring, manual restart, log viewing

### 4. Cursor Integration Guide (`CURSOR_SETUP.md`)
- **Complete setup instructions**: Step-by-step guide for Cursor configuration
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
- **Best practices**: Proactive maintenance and monitoring recommendations
- **Performance optimization**: Resource management and connection pooling tips

## Key Features Added

### Reliability Features
- ✅ **Automatic health monitoring** every 30 seconds
- ✅ **Automatic restart** on failures
- ✅ **Persistent browser cache** across restarts
- ✅ **Resource limits** to prevent memory issues
- ✅ **Connection pooling** for multiple concurrent connections

### Monitoring Features
- ✅ **Real-time status checking** with `./monitor-playwright.sh status`
- ✅ **Continuous monitoring** with `./monitor-playwright.sh monitor`
- ✅ **Automatic recovery** when issues are detected
- ✅ **Detailed logging** for troubleshooting
- ✅ **Resource usage monitoring**

### Performance Features
- ✅ **Browser caching** to reduce startup time
- ✅ **Memory management** to prevent crashes
- ✅ **Connection timeout handling**
- ✅ **Automatic cleanup** of browser instances

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# Rebuild and start the improved container
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d

# Check status
./monitor-playwright.sh status

# Start continuous monitoring (optional)
./monitor-playwright.sh monitor
```

### Cursor Configuration
Add this to your Cursor settings:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8081/mcp",
      "timeout": 30000,
      "retries": 3
    }
  }
}
```

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Quick status check
./monitor-playwright.sh status

# Start continuous monitoring
./monitor-playwright.sh monitor

# Manual restart
./monitor-playwright.sh restart

# View logs
./monitor-playwright.sh logs

# Check resource usage
./monitor-playwright.sh resources
```

## Expected Results

### Before Improvements
- ❌ Intermittent MCP unavailability
- ❌ Red status in Cursor
- ❌ Manual intervention required
- ❌ No automatic recovery
- ❌ Browser reinstallation on restarts

### After Improvements
- ✅ Consistent MCP availability
- ✅ Green status in Cursor
- ✅ Automatic recovery from issues
- ✅ Persistent browser cache
- ✅ Proactive monitoring and alerts

## Maintenance Recommendations

### Daily
- Run `./monitor-playwright.sh status` to verify health
- Check logs if any issues are reported

### Weekly
- Review monitoring logs: `/tmp/playwright-mcp-monitor.log`
- Check resource usage with `./monitor-playwright.sh resources`

### Monthly
- Update Playwright MCP to latest version
- Review and clean up old logs
- Verify backup procedures

## Troubleshooting

### If MCP Status Still Shows Red
1. Run `./monitor-playwright.sh status` to diagnose
2. Check container logs: `docker logs Playwright-MCP`
3. Restart container: `./monitor-playwright.sh restart`
4. Verify port 8081 is not blocked by firewall

### If Container Won't Start
1. Check Docker resources: `docker system df`
2. Verify network connectivity: `docker network ls`
3. Check for port conflicts: `netstat -tlnp | grep 8081`

### If Browser Operations Fail
1. Check browser cache: `docker exec Playwright-MCP ls -la /home/playwright/.cache/ms-playwright`
2. Reinstall browsers if needed: `docker exec Playwright-MCP npx playwright install chromium`

## Success Metrics

The improvements should result in:
- **99%+ uptime** for the MCP server
- **Consistent green status** in Cursor
- **Automatic recovery** from temporary issues
- **Reduced manual intervention** required
- **Faster startup times** due to browser caching

## Support

If you continue to experience issues:
1. Check the monitoring logs: `/tmp/playwright-mcp-monitor.log`
2. Review container logs: `docker logs Playwright-MCP`
3. Verify system resources and Docker configuration
4. Consider updating to the latest Playwright MCP version

The improved configuration should provide much more stable and reliable connectivity for your Cursor agent!
