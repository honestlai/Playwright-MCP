# Playwright MCP Docker Container

A simple dockerized setup of Playwright MCP for browser automation.

## About This Project

While Playwright is a great tool set up by Microsoft, I couldn't find any simple information on how to stand this up as a Docker container. The little guidance I got from GPT had me stand up a container that was DOA (Dead On Arrival), so I decided to just make a quick and dirty dockerized setup of it that my dev containers / Cursor can access easily.
