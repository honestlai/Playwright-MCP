# Playwright MCP Docker Container

A simple dockerized setup of Playwright MCP for browser automation.

## About This Project

While Playwright is a great tool set up by Microsoft, I couldn't find any simple information on how to stand this up as a Docker container. The little guidance I got from GPT had me stand up a container that was DOA (Dead On Arrival), so I decided to just make a quick and dirty dockerized setup of it that my dev containers / Cursor can access easily.

## üöÄ What Playwright MCP Can Do

The Playwright MCP is a **game-changer for web development** in Cursor/VS Code. It provides:

- **Full browser automation** directly from your editor
- **Web scraping and testing** without leaving your IDE
- **Screenshot capture** and visual testing
- **Form filling and navigation** automation
- **PDF generation** from web pages
- **Mobile device emulation** for responsive testing
- **Network interception** and debugging
- **Performance monitoring** and metrics

This MCP transforms your development workflow by bringing browser automation capabilities right into your coding environment, making web app development, testing, and debugging incredibly efficient.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This container provides two connection modes optimized for different deployment scenarios:

### **Command-Based Mode (Recommended for SSH/Remote)**
- **Best for**: SSH tunnels, remote servers, Cloudflare connections
- **How it works**: Client executes MCP server directly via `docker exec`
- **Benefits**: No persistent HTTP connections, eliminates timeout issues
- **Use case**: When you're connecting over SSH or experiencing connection drops

### **HTTP Mode (Suitable for Local)**
- **Best for**: Local development, direct connections
- **How it works**: MCP server runs as HTTP service on port 8080
- **Benefits**: Standard MCP protocol, familiar HTTP endpoints
- **Use case**: When running locally without network issues

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Cursor or VS Code with MCP support

### 1. Clone and Start
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Playwright-MCP
docker compose up -d
```

### 2. Configure Your MCP Client

#### For Command-Based Mode (SSH/Remote Recommended)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Playwright_MCP": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "exec",
        "-i",
        "Playwright-MCP",
        "npx",
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--headless",
        "--isolated"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### For HTTP Mode (Local Development)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Playwright_MCP": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8081/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Verify Installation
```bash
# Check container status
docker ps | grep Playwright-MCP

# Test command-based execution
docker exec -i Playwright-MCP npx @playwright/mcp@latest --headless --isolated --help
```

## üìä Connection Mode Comparison

| Feature | Command-Based | HTTP Mode |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **SSH Stability** | ‚úÖ Excellent | ‚ö†Ô∏è May timeout |
| **Connection Drops** | ‚úÖ None | ‚ö†Ô∏è Can occur |
| **Setup Complexity** | ‚ö†Ô∏è More config | ‚úÖ Simple |
| **Performance** | ‚úÖ Optimal | ‚úÖ Good |
| **Local Development** | ‚úÖ Works | ‚úÖ Works |
| **Remote Development** | ‚úÖ Recommended | ‚ùå Not recommended |

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
environment:
  - PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/ms-playwright
  - NODE_ENV=production
```

### Port Mapping
```yaml
ports:
  - "127.0.0.1:8081:8080"  # HTTP mode endpoint
```

### Resource Limits
```yaml
mem_limit: 4g
mem_reservation: 2g
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Basic Browser Automation
```javascript
// Navigate to a website
await browser.navigate({ url: "https://example.com" });

// Take a screenshot
await browser.take_screenshot({ 
  filename: "screenshot.png",
  fullPage: true 
});

// Fill a form
await browser.type({ 
  element: "input[name='username']", 
  text: "myuser" 
});
```

### Advanced Features
```javascript
// Mobile emulation
await browser.navigate({ 
  url: "https://example.com",
  device: "iPhone 15" 
});

// PDF generation
await browser.evaluate({ 
  function: "() => window.print()" 
});

// Network monitoring
await browser.network_requests();
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Container Health
```bash
# Check container status
docker ps | grep Playwright-MCP

# View logs
docker logs Playwright-MCP

# Health check
curl -v http://localhost:8081/mcp
```

### Common Issues

#### Connection Drops (SSH/Remote)
- **Solution**: Switch to command-based mode
- **Why**: Eliminates persistent HTTP connections that can timeout

#### Container Won't Start
- **Check**: Port 8081 availability
- **Fix**: `docker compose down && docker compose up -d`

#### MCP Tools Not Available
- **Check**: Client configuration
- **Verify**: Container is healthy and running

## üìà Performance

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: ~200MB typical usage
- **CPU**: Low usage during idle
- **Network**: Minimal overhead

### Optimization Tips
- Use `--headless` mode for automation
- Enable `--isolated` for clean sessions
- Monitor resource usage with `docker stats`
